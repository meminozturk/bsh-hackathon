# Winning Solution to B/S/H Analytics for Production Excellence Hackathon 2017

We are proud of successfully winning the first place in Analytics for Production Excellence Hackathon arranged by BSH in Istanbul on 13-14 May 2017 to analyze BSH's Factory data regarding Production, Maintenance and Quality.

Generally, BSH wants to achieve Production Excellence. For this purpose, we were supposed to analyze data outcomes of Dishcare Factory and come up with an idea in order to decrease defects, scraps, customer returns, hence, increase overall customer satisfaction. So, There was no specific target or task. 



There are three types of analysis data as result of this process:
First Pass Yield – FPY: The yield is an indicator for the ratio of error-free products out of the total production.
Weigthed Failure Rate – WFR: An indicator of possible claims from the field and reflects the quality of the entire manufacturing process. When totalling up individual defect rates, the respective defect rates must be weighted by production quantities.
Technical Call Rate – TCR:  The key performance indicators Technical Call Rate (TCR),describes the ratio of failures of appliances produced in a defined manufacturing period and the number of appliances produced within this period.
